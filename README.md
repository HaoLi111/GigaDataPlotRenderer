# GigaDataPlotRenderer
An engine to render plots for datasets in gigabite-scale,    based on pixel-wise rendering on large matrices. It is designed to    overcome the shortages of existing R plotting packages (speed and     memory usage). It is most suitable for big data representation,     image accentuation, and fractal(chaotic system) visualization.
