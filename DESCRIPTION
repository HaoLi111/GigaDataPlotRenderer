Description: An engine to render plots for datasets in gigabite-scale,
   based on pixel-wise rendering on large matrices. It is designed to
   overcome the shortages of existing R plotting packages (speed and 
   memory usage). It is most suitable for big data representation, 
   image accentuation, and fractal(chaotic system) visualization.
